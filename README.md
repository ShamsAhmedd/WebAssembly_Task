# Quick Sort: JavaScript vs WebAssembly (WASM)

This task demonstrates the performance difference between **JavaScript** and **WebAssembly (WASM)** when executing a computationally intensive algorithm.

The same **Quick Sort** algorithm is implemented in:
- JavaScript
- C compiled to WebAssembly using **Emscripten**

The comparison focuses on **execution time**, especially for large arrays, to highlight where WebAssembly can provide performance benefits.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- C
- WebAssembly (WASM)
- Emscripten
- HTML / CSS

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a number representing the **array size**
2. A random array is generated
3. The same Quick Sort algorithm is executed using:
   - JavaScript
   - WebAssembly
4. Execution time is measured using `performance.now()`
5. The first 20 sorted elements and execution time are displayed

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Requirements

- Any modern web browser
- Python installed **OR** any local web server

---

### 2️⃣ Run Using a Local Server (Recommended)

From the project directory, run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open in your browser:
http://localhost:8000

### Compile C to WebAssembly (Optional)
#### If you want to regenerate the WebAssembly files yourself, install Emscripten and run:

emcc quick.c -o quick.js \-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_quick_sort']" \-s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['ccall']"

## Expected Results

-For small array sizes, JavaScript performance may be similar
-For large array sizes, WebAssembly often shows better or more stable execution time
-Demonstrates why WebAssembly is suitable for CPU-intensive tasks
